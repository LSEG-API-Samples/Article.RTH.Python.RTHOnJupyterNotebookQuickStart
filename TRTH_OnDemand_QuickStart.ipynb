    "[Tick History or TRTH](https://developers.refinitiv.com/thomson-reuters-tick-history-trth)  is an Internet-hosted product on [DataScope Select platform or DSS](https://developers.refinitiv.com/datascope-select-dss). TRTH is a historical market data service, offering global data dating back to January 1996, for example, intraday summaries, end of days prices, time and sales, market depth and raw data. TRTH provides [REST API](https://phpenthusiast.com/blog/what-is-rest-api) to access all data. In this article, I will demonstrate how to retrieve intraday summaries using an on demand request.\n",
